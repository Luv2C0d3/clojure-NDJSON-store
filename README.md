# NDJSON Repository

A Clojure library for NDJSON-based repositories with O(1) lookups through in-memory indexing.

## Structure

- `src/org/clojars/luv2c0d3/ndjson_repository/ndjson.clj` - Core NDJSON repository implementation
- `test/org/clojars/luv2c0d3/ndjson_repository/` - Example implementations demonstrating different use cases:
  - `bubas_test.clj` - Example using the repository for bear-related data
  - `client_test.clj` - Example using the repository for client data storage
  - `tokens_test.clj` - Example using the repository for token storage

Each test file demonstrates a different way to use the NDJSON repository, showing how it can be adapted for various data storage needs while maintaining O(1) lookups through in-memory indexing.
